          <h1 class=>Welcome</h1>
          <div class="media-body">
            <p>We are team 10, and this is the term project for <strong>CS489 Computer Ethics and Social
              Issues (Autumn 2019)</strong>.</p>
            <p>This is a simple demo version of Forus, a debate platform to help you have a balanced view.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Forus?</h3>
            <p>Forus is a forum where you can learn, converse, and understand people with different ideas.<br>
            </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                <h4>Listen to both sides</h4>
                We don't show polls. We give you strong arguments from both sides. You will read arguments
                which have received many approvals from opposing camp and you will make your decision
                not by following majority, but by your own reasons.
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                <h4>Make your stance</h4>
                In order to participate in a debate, you need to make your stance. You can vote for
                strong opinions of both sides, but only votes for the opponents will be shown to others.
                Once you take a side, you can freely leave comments or post opinions on the topic.
                Remember, people with opposing ideas grant yours. Carefully organize your logic and word choices.
              </div>

              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
                <h4>Meet challenges</h4>
                Once you are in a debate, you will be more exposed to opposing ideas. In other words, we will
                try to persuade you. Test your reasoning, but don't be stubborn! It's not about winning or losing -
                It's about rationality, and bringing people closer.
              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Forus?</h3>
            <p>There are no forums and social networks that do not currently divide people's opinions. Social networks are a good meeting place, but not a good place of consensus. The problem with current social networks and community sites is that they only bring people together in a similar group. But won't it just reinforce the thoughts you originally had?

              Forus ultimately wants to be an alternative social network. I hope it will be a gathering place for those who want to reasonably discuss. I want to be a place like Athens' Agora.</p>


            <h3>Forus recommendation system</h3>

            <p>The principle of the AI ​​recommendation system currently used on YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook is to find a group with similar preferences. Because recommending a favorite movie or video by someone who likes something similar to you can have a high chance of satisfying your viewers.

              Seeing only what you like is about defining limits for yourself. Especially in matters of politics, ethics and ideology, we need to listen to the other side.
              In democracy, there is no answer, but there is agreement. Forus will recommend opinions from people who think differently from you. You may be uncomfortable seeing it.
              Forus' referral system does not target a lot of revenue and views. I would like to draw meaningful agreements, even at least.
              You won't have fun with Forus' recommendation system, but your ideas will surely improve.</p>
