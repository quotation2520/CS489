<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>We are team 10, and this is the term project for <strong>CS489 Computer Ethics and Social
        Issues (Autumn 2019)</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a simple demo version of Forus, a debate platform to help you have a balanced view.
</p>
<h3>What is Forus?</h3>
<p>Forus is a forum where you can learn, converse, and understand people with different ideas.<br>

        <h4>Listen to both sides</h4>
        We don't show polls. We give you strong arguments from both sides. You will read arguments
        which have received many approvals from opposing camp and you will make your decision
        not by following majority, but by your own reasons.
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
        <h4>Make your stance</h4>
        In order to participate in a debate, you need to make your stance. You can vote for
        strong opinions of both sides, but only votes for the opponents will be shown to others.
        Once you take a side, you can freely leave comments or post opinions on the topic.
        Remember, people with opposing ideas grant yours. Carefully organize your logic and word choices.

        <h4>Meet challenges</h4>
        Once you are in a debate, you will be more exposed to opposing ideas. In other words, we will
        try to persuade you. Test your reasoning, but don't be stubborn! It's not about winning or losing -
        It's about rationality, and bringing people closer.
